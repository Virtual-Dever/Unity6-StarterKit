Great! Here’s a polished **GitHub README-style version** of your Unity Starter Kit introduction, with clear sections and formatting:

# Unity Starter Kit v0.1.3

## 📌 Overview

**Unity Starter Kit v0.1.3** is a development package designed to simplify the process of starting new Unity projects.
It bundles essential plugins, tools, design pattern samples, and a custom framework to accelerate game development.

## 📂 Components

The Starter Kit is divided into three main parts:

1. **Plugins & Tools**

   * Free assets downloaded from the Unity Asset Store.
   * Commonly required for most game development projects.

2. **Design Pattern Samples**

   * Sample codes demonstrating widely used design patterns in Unity.

3. **Custom Framework**

   * A lightweight framework developed to streamline project setup and improve code structure.

## 📝 Brief Project Description

Before starting a new project with Unity 6, we have gathered the necessary development assets.

This project originated from the hassle of repeatedly fetching the same common plugins and tools from the Unity Asset Store every time a new project was created. To solve this, frequently used assets were bundled together along with the custom framework.

## 🎯 Project Goals and Direction

* **Shorten the development schedule**
* **Improve productivity** by creating reusable modules commonly used in game development
* **Continuously enhance the framework** to help programmers improve their skills and accumulate technical expertise

👉 Would you like me to also make this look like a **formal product landing page (marketing-style)** with a more **visual/engaging tone** instead of just a technical README?
